# Kojoeditor

This is a personal project for learning. I want to explore the go language and it's features while implementing a text editor from scratch. That will also give me insite in some low level aspects, such as the rope datastructure and how to interact with the terminal using ascii.

## Project status

This project is sort of working, but far from finnished.
